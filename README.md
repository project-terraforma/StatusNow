# StatusNow - Place Status Classification

This project aims to classify whether a place (POI) is Open or Closed based on its metadata and derived mobility signals.

## Data

- `data/Season 2 Samples 3k Project Updated.parquet`: The dataset containing place samples with a balanced distribution (~60% Open / 40% Closed).
- `data/processed_with_mobility.parquet`: The intermediate dataset containing Geocoded POIs and Mobility Scores (from Fused).
- `data/processed_for_ml.parquet`: The final processed dataset with all engineering features (generated by `process_data.py`).

### Final Schema (for Machine Learning)

The `processed_for_ml.parquet` file contains the following engineered features used to train the model:

## Scripts

- **`read_data.py`**: Reads and displays the raw parquet data schema and first few rows.
- **`inspect_data.py`**: Performs deep inspection of the data, checking for valid IDs, class balance, and feature correlations.
- **`enrich_with_fused.py`**: **NEW**. Geocodes addresses to Lat/Lon (via OSM) and simulates/fetches mobility data using Fused.io. Adds `mobility_score` and `is_ghost_candidate`.
- **`process_data.py`**: The main ETL script. It reads the data (preferring enriched), parses JSON fields, creates features (Confidence, One-Hot Categories, Recency, Social Platforms, Mobility), and saves the result to `data/processed_for_ml.parquet`.
- **`experiment_runner.py`**: Runs 5-Fold Cross Validation on multiple models (Balanced Random Forest, XGBoost) and reports metrics.

## Setup

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (Standard + Spatial)
pip install duckdb pandas numpy pyarrow scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost fused geopandas shapely requests tqdm
```

## Usage

1. Inspect the raw data:
   ```bash
   python3 read_data.py
   python3 inspect_data.py
   ```
2. Enrich Data (Geocoding + Mobility):
   ```bash
   # This runs geocoding (takes time) and adds mobility_score
   python3 enrich_with_fused.py
   ```
3. Generate features:
   ```bash
   python3 process_data.py
   ```
4. Run Model Experiments:
   ```bash
   python3 experiment_runner.py
   ```

## Model Experiments & Findings

We compared **Balanced Random Forest** vs **XGBoost** to predict if a place is closed based on static metadata, including new **Recency**, **Social Platform**, and **Mobility** features.

### Results (Balanced Accuracy)

| Model           | Balanced Acc | Performance Analysis                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **XGBoost**     | **66.17%**   | **New Peak**. The addition of **Mobility Signals** (Geocodability + Activity Proxy) pushed performance to a new high. |
| **Balanced RF** | 64.28%       | **Regressed**. Random Forest struggled to utilize the sparse mobility data effectively compared to gradient boosting. |

### Key Insights

1.  **Mobility & Geocoding**: The process of geocoding addresses and checking for mobility proved valuable. Places that couldn't be geocoded or had zero extrapolated activity were more likely to be Closed.
2.  **Recency Matters**: "Days Since Last Update" remains a critical differentiator.
3.  **Source Signal**: The **Number of Sources** remains the dominant predictor.
4.  **Ceiling**: We have successfully moved the needle from ~63% to **66.2%** through feature engineering alone. Further improvements would likely require real-time verification (phone calls/web scraping).
