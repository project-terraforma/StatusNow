# StatusNow - Place Status Classification

This project aims to classify whether a place (POI) is Open or Closed based on its metadata and derived mobility signals.

## Data

- `data/Season 2 Samples 3k Project Updated.parquet`: **PRIMARY DATASET** (10/90 split). Contains 3,000 place samples with baseline comparison data (~60% Open / 40% Closed).
- `data/Project C Samples.parquet`: Alternative dataset (60/40 split, 3,425 rows) from a different assignment. Can be used if helpful.
- `data/processed_for_ml.parquet`: The final processed dataset with all engineered features including **delta features** (generated by `process_data.py`).

### Final Schema (for Machine Learning)

The `processed_for_ml.parquet` file contains the following engineered features used to train the model:

- **Features**: 49 total (including 12 delta features)
- **Class Balance**: 60.3% Open, 39.7% Closed
- **Key Innovation**: Delta features comparing baseline historical data with current data

### 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH: V2 Results (Advanced Feature Engineering)

### Key Insights

#### V2 Advanced Features (What Drove the Breakthrough)

1. **Interaction Features Unlock Performance**: Capturing temporal relationships pushed past the 67% ceiling
   - **`recency_x_loss`**: Recent digital presence loss is a much stronger signal than old losses
   - **`zombie_score`**: num_sources / avg_days_since_update identifies "database purgatory" (high sources but very stale data)
   - **`decay_velocity`**: Rate of digital footprint decline
   - **`confidence_momentum`**: How quickly confidence is changing over time

2. **Category-Specific Risk Modeling**: Same signal means different things for different industries
   - **`category_churn_risk`**: Gas stations have ~10% churn, boutiques have ~45% churn
   - Losing a website matters MORE for high-churn categories
   - Industry context significantly improved precision

3. **PCA Reduces Overfitting**: Replaced 2 highly correlated recency features (r=0.97) with 1 PCA component
   - **Explained variance**: 98.68%
   - Prevented "double counting" of data age
   - Improved generalization

4. **Digital Congruence**: Website domain matching social handles = brand consistency signal

#### V1 Delta Features Foundation

5. **Delta Features Remain Critical**: Baseline vs current comparison is the foundation
   - **`has_gained_social`** (r=+0.26) - Still the strongest single predictor
   - **`has_any_loss`** (r=-0.17) - Strong closure signal
   - **`delta_total_contact`** (r=+0.19) - Overall change in digital footprint

6. **CatBoost Dominates**: 70.65% balanced accuracy with V2 features - best overall model

7. **Generalizability**: Model uses NO mobility data, applicable worldwide with Overture Maps data

8. **Breaking the Ceiling**: V2 features addressed the "Zombie POI" problem - places stuck in database purgatory but physically closed

### Top Predictive Features

1. `has_gained_social` (+0.26 correlation) - Gained social media → Open
2. `delta_total_contact` (+0.19) - Positive contact info change → Open
3. `delta_num_socials` (+0.18) - More social media → Open
4. `has_any_loss` (-0.17) - Lost any digital presence → Closed
5. `delta_confidence` (+0.17) - Confidence increase → Open

### Feature Selection Analysis

To avoid overfitting (49 features on 3,000 samples), we performed feature selection analysis:

**Key Findings:**

- ⚠️ **7 near-zero variance features** found (e.g., `has_instagram`, `has_conflicting_websites`)
- ⚠️ **15 highly correlated pairs** (r > 0.9) indicating redundancy:
  - `has_social` ↔ `has_facebook` (r=1.0) - perfectly correlated
  - `has_social` ↔ `len_socials` (r=1.0) - redundant
  - `has_website` ↔ `has_lost_website` (r=-0.94) - inverse relationship
  - `days_since_latest_update` ↔ `avg_days_since_update` (r=0.97) - highly redundant

**Optimal Feature Set: 30 features** 🎯

- **Performance**: 0.6782 balanced accuracy (vs 0.6738 with 48 features)
- **Improvement**: +0.43% by removing 18 redundant/low-importance features
- **Reduced overfitting**: Better generalization with fewer features

**Top 10 Most Important Features (by Random Forest):**

1. `avg_days_since_update` (14.6%)
2. `delta_confidence` (12.5%)
3. `days_since_latest_update` (10.5%)
4. `confidence` (9.8%)
5. `num_sources` (5.6%)
6. `delta_num_socials` (4.6%)
7. `delta_total_contact` (3.6%)
8. `is_brand` (3.2%)
9. `cat_other` (3.1%)
10. `source_has_msft` (3.0%)

**Features to Remove (9 lowest importance):**

- `has_instagram`, `has_conflicting_websites` (zero variance/importance)
- `has_gained_phone`, `has_lost_phone`, `delta_num_phones` (phones rarely change)
- `has_lost_website`, `has_gained_website` (redundant with delta features)
- Category features: `cat_landmark_and_historical_building`, `cat_automotive_repair`

See `recommended_features.txt` for the complete 30-feature list.

### Recommendations

- **For Production**: Use **CatBoost with V2 features** (70.65% balanced accuracy) 🏆
- **For Interpretability**: Use Logistic Regression V2 (68.46% balanced accuracy, transparent coefficients)
- **For Precision**: Use XGBoost V2 (69.31% balanced accuracy)
- **To Merge More Data**: Run `python process_data_v2.py --merge` to combine Season 2 + Project C (~6,400 samples)

### Advanced Features (V2) Summary

The breakthrough came from 10 new features across 4 categories:

1. **Interaction Features (5)**:
   - `recency_x_loss`, `recency_x_social_loss` - Temporal context matters
   - `zombie_score` - Database purgatory detection
   - `decay_velocity`, `confidence_momentum` - Rate of change signals

2. **Category Risk (1)**:
   - `category_churn_risk` - Industry-specific closure rates

3. **Digital Consistency (1)**:
   - `digital_congruence` - Website/social handle matching

4. **PCA Dimensionality Reduction (1)**:
   - `recency_pca` - Replaced 2 correlated features (98.68% variance explained)

## Journey Summary: From Baseline to Breakthrough

1. **Baseline Approach**: Traditional features (confidence, categories, sources) → ~64% balanced accuracy
2. **Delta Features (V1)**: Added baseline vs current comparison → **67.3% balanced accuracy** (+3.3%)
3. **Feature Selection**: Identified 30 optimal features, removed redundancy → **67.8% on subset** (+0.5%)
4. **Advanced Engineering (V2)**: Interaction features + category risk + PCA → **🎯 70.65% balanced accuracy (+3.35%, total +6.65% from baseline)**

### What We Learned

- **Temporal context matters most**: When digital presence changed is as important as what changed
- **Industry differences are real**: Gas stations ≠ Boutiques in terms of closure signals
- **Redundancy hurts**: Perfect correlation (r=1.0) between features means wasted model capacity
- **"Zombie POIs" are solvable**: High source count + stale data = strong closure signal
- **Generalization is possible**: No mobility data required, applicable worldwide

### Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Scale up**: Merge Project C dataset with `python process_data_v2.py --merge`→ 6,400 samples
2. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Grid search on CatBoost could push to 71%+
3. **Ensemble**: Stack CatBoost + XGBoost for final 0.5-1% boost
4. **Spatial features**: Add competitor density if coordinates become available
5. **Deploy**: Package V2 model for production use
